In this project, I've developed a web application for task management. The application features include:

Creating tasks with a specified due date and priority.
Deleting tasks.
Sorting tasks by date or priority.
Searching tasks.
Switching between light and dark themes.
User registration and authentication.
The project utilizes technologies such as React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and MUI components. Tasks are stored using a json server.
