# Task Management Web Application

## Introduction
The application enables registered and authenticated users to create personal tasks, organize them according to various criteria, and manage these tasks through options like deletion and renaming. Users can also assign tasks to other registered members. This project was created at the beginning of my career path. The project was created using Create React App, which is now considered outdated.

- **Redux Toolkit**: A toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
